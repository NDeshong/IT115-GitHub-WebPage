                <p>
                    Mobile development refers to mobile applications, also known as "apps," applications developed for use on a mobile device such as IOS or Android. Unlike many other fields, mobile development does not have a bias toward people with a bachelor's degree. Instead, many developers learned on their own through the internet. Since 48.3% of the world owns a smartphone, the market for mobile apps is enormous. As a result, mobile development will continue growing for years to come.
